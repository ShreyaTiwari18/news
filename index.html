            <p>Terrorist Attack at Reasi Sets Alarm Bells Ringing in India’s Security Establishment.
            Security men inspect a bus that fell into a deep gorge on Sunday after it was fired at by suspected militants in Reasi district, Jammu and Kashmir, June 10, 2024. </p>

            <p>Last week was a bloody one in Jammu and Kashmir. Between June 9 and 12, militants carried out four attacks in the union territory’s Jammu region, three of them in a span of 24 hours.
            A fifth attack happened in Bandipora in the Kashmir region on June 17.
            The serial bloodletting began in Reasi district on June 9, when terrorists opened fire on a bus carrying Hindu pilgrims to the Vaishno Devi shrine. The driver lost control of the bus, causing it to veer off the road and plunge into a gorge. Nine people were killed and 33 others injured.</p>

            <p>The attack in Reasi happened at around 6:15 p.m., less than an hour before Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for a third consecutive term in New Delhi.
            Three attacks followed in quick succession on June 11-12. One was at a village in Kathua near the International Border between India and Pakistan. Two militants and a Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed in the gunfight that followed. There were two separate attacks on checkpoints at Gandoh and Chattergala in Doda district resulting in injury to seven security personnel.</p>

            <p>The attacks in Jammu, especially the one at Reasi, have set off alarm bells in India’s security establishment.
            Following the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s autonomy in August 2019, the Modi government stepped up its crackdown on militants and the separatist ecosystem in the Kashmir Valley. On the run from the counterinsurgency operations in Kashmir, militants began to shift their operations to the Jammu region. Jammu, which had been relatively militancy-free over the preceding 15 years or so, began to see militant attacks from 2021.</p>

            <p>Unlike the overwhelmingly Muslim (96.4 percent) Kashmir Valley, Jammu’s population is more mixed. While Hindus comprise 62.5 percent of the region’s population overall, the proportion of Hindus to Muslims varies from district to district. A terror attack targeting civilians could prompt Hindu-Muslim tensions and violence.</p>

            <p>On August 14, 1993, terrorists targeted a civilian bus at Kishtwar. Hindus among the passengers were identified and 17 of them were shot dead. The first of several massacres of Hindus in Jammu, the Kishtwar attack triggered Hindu-Muslim clashes.</p>

            <p>More terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in the coming months could make the conducting of elections difficult.
            It will be a handy excuse for the Modi government to postpone assembly elections yet again.</p>
